# pyqt-multi-language-example
Simple example of how to support multi language with JSON and python dictionary in PyQt

Not to mention, PyQt5 needed

and i've used JSON file (don't use Qt Linguist or QTranslator, gettext or anything like that since it is hard to do and not so fluent, pretty much "prompt command hell" to me) 

How to run? clone this and python main.py and baam that's it

You can add your own language to understand how this works :) Better be
